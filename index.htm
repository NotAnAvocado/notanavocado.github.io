		<h1>Not an Avocado</h1>
		<h2>A One-Man Medical Software Development Team</h2>

	<div class="content">
		<p class="intro">Not an Avocado is a Sydney-based software developer specialising in medical and educational software packages.</p>
		<p>There are currently two primary packages in the works: <b>PharQuiz</b>, which aims become a fully-fledged revision tool for scientific and medical educational settings, and <b>TremorSense</b>, which aims to produce a standardised, quantified measurement scale for tremor associated with a variety of neuro- and psychological contitions.</p>
		<h2>PharQuiz</h2>
		<p><i>PharQuiz is currently in an early, unstable state of development. As it stands, the tool is capable of assessing knowledge of a drug's class, molecular action, clinical use, mechanism of action and adverse effects. This is going to be expanded over the coming months into a more flexible tool for educational assessment.</i></p>
		<h2>TremorSense</h2>
		<p>It's somewhat remarkable that there is no standard scale for quantifying tremor. At the moment, if you present to a clinic with tremor, the standard methods of assessment are visual examination by the practitioner and the "glass test," which is essentially a measure of how difficult it is for the patient to pick up and drink from a glass of water. TremorSense aims to quantify tremor intensity by a specialised algorithm that measures vibrations via the accelerometers in a smartphone (currently limited to Android).</p>
		<p>Tremor is associated with a variety of conditions of neurological and psychiatric origin: Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, essential tremor, and as a side effect of medication.</p>
