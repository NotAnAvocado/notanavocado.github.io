		<h2>TremorSense</h2>
		<p>It's somewhat remarkable that there is no standard scale for quantifying tremor. At the moment, if you present to a clinic with tremor, the standard methods of assessment are visual examination by the practitioner and the "glass test," which is essentially a measure of how difficult it is for the patient to pick up and drink from a glass of water. TremorSense aims to quantify tremor intensity by a specialised algorithm that measures vibrations via the accelerometers in a smartphone (currently limited to Android).</p>
		<p>It works by taking 1000 measurements and then taking the standard deviation of those measurements. This is obviously a flawed system, because SD is greatly affected by the user rotating their hand during measurement.
		<p>Tremor is associated with a variety of conditions of neurological and psychiatric origin: Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety, essential tremor, and as a side effect of medication.</p>
